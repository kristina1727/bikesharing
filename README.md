## Overview
Purpose of this analysis was to utilize Tableau to analyze the Citi Bike data to determine what data would be applicable to implementing a similar bike sharing program in Des Moines, IA.

## Results

**Checkout Times**

Regardless of the gender trip duration contines to peak around the 5 minute mark. Though here we are able to see that males make up a significant portion of our customer base.

**Trips by Day of the Week**

The busiest times are Monday through Friday betweek 8:00-9:00 AM and 5:00-7:00 PM, customers traveling to and from work. The weekends also have a pretty stady flow of users between 10:00 AM and 6:00 PM, most likely tourists.

**Trips by Gender**

Agen Gender does not seem to show a difference in the time in which the bike utilization is heaviest but it continues to support that males make up a significant portion of our customer base.

Shows that subscriber utilization is heaviest througout the week, though continues to remain heavily utilized during the weekends as well. However, non-subscriber traffic is heavier during the weekends.

**Bike Utilization**

Shows that some bikes are significantly more utilized than others and my need repairs/maintenance more frequently.

**Top Locations**

Shows that the top ending locations are near other public transportation hubs, near NYU and popular tourist attractions.

## Summary
Overall, we are able to determine that males tend to make up the majority of our customer base, though gender does not tend to have an effect on the trip duration or the time in which the bikes are utilized. We are also able to see that Subscribers make up the mojority of our customer base.

Two additional visualiztions that could be completed with the dataset would be the average trip duration by age and gender and a comparison of the top starting and ending locations. Though the data is not available here, it would be interesting to dive deeper into those bikes that were most heavily utilized to determine if it was their placement on the bike rack that cause them to be most heavily used.
